# JSAMR backups
`backup_sql.sh` fetches entire db and dumps wherever you call it from  
`backup_ojsuploads.sh` fetches entire uploads folder and dumps wherever you call it from

These scripts are both on JSAMR's server in `~/backups`  

Both have been added to crontab on JSAMR's server, and barf to it@nsamr.ac.uk  


## To get these onto another machine
`get_latest_backup.sh` will grab the most recent file in whatever folder you point it at  


# NSAMR.ac.uk backups
